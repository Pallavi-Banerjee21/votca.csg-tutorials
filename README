This is a collection of coarse-graining tutorials using the 
VOTCA package. Further information on VOTCA can be found at

The development of VOTCA is mainly funded by academic research grants.

The following tutorials (compare with paper above) are included. They all rely
on Gromacs unless specified otherwise:

spce/atomistic             atomistic reference simulations for SPC/E water
spce/ibm                   boltzmann inversion for SPC/E water
spce/imc                   inverse monte carlo for SPC/E water

methanol/atomistic         atomistic simulations for methanol
methanol/ibm               boltzmann inversion for methanol
methanol/ibm_espresso      boltzmann inversion for methanol using ESPResSo
methanol/imc               inverse monte carlo for methanol

propane/ibm                iterative inverse boltzmann for nonbonded
                           interactions of liquid propane
propante/ibm_espresso      iterative inverse boltzmann for nonbonded
                           interactions of liquid propane using ESPResSo
propane/single_chain       atomistic simulations, boltzmann inversion 
                           and force matching for a single chain of propane

each of the tutorials contains a run.sh which lists all commands
needed to execute the tutorial.
